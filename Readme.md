## General info
This repo refers to the IBM AI Engineering Certificate from IBM.
This 6-course Professional Certificate is designed to acquire the tools to succeed in your career as an AI or ML engineer.  
	Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
	Scalable Machine Learning on Big Data using Apache Spark
	Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras
	Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch
	Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow
	AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning
	Machine Learning with Python

## Concepts
Fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, using programming languages like Python.
I applied popular machine learning and deep learning libraries such as SciPy, ScikitLearn, Keras, PyTorch, and Tensorflow to industry problems involving object recognition, computer vision, image and video processing, text analytics, natural language processing (NLP), recommender systems, and other types of classifiers.
