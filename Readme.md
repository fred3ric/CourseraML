## Concepts
Fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, using programming languages like Python.
I applied popular machine learning and deep learning libraries such as SciPy, ScikitLearn, Keras, PyTorch, and Tensorflow to industry problems involving object recognition, computer vision, image and video processing, text analytics, natural language processing (NLP), recommender systems, and other types of classifiers
